🚨 Securing Files in Real-Time with Python: Automated Alerts & Monitoring 🔒💻

As the digital landscape continues to evolve, file integrity becomes more critical than ever. I’m thrilled to share a File Integrity Monitoring System I developed using Python! 🐍

This tool continuously monitors directories for file changes (creation, modification, or deletion), and automatically sends email alerts whenever suspicious activity is detected. 📧⚠️

Key Highlights:
📂 Real-Time Monitoring: Tracks changes in files and directories as they happen.
🔔 Instant Email Alerts: Get notified immediately when files are created, modified, or deleted.
📜 Detailed Logs: Keeps track of all events for future reference and analysis.
🛡️ Enhanced Security: Ideal for securing critical files and sensitive data.
🔧 What I used:

Python: Leveraged the power of Python with the Watchdog library for file system monitoring.
Email Automation (SMTP): Integrated Gmail SMTP to send notifications.
Logging: Added robust logging for real-time event tracking.
🔍 Why is this important? With this tool, file integrity can be ensured by detecting unauthorized changes and preventing potential data loss or breaches. Whether it’s for network security, data protection, or system administration, this is a must-have tool for businesses handling sensitive information. 🏢🔐

I’m excited about how automation and real-time monitoring can help strengthen cybersecurity. 🚀
